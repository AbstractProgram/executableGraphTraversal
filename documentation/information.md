### Usage examples
Different applications may use this module:
- AST representation in NoSQL database.
- Task/command runner with ability for synchronous or async execution.
- Template system for creating complex templates. 
- etc.

### nodeRelationshipGraph concepts

- Relationship Graph: conveying of relational information. Directed graph. _Terminolog: ReusableNestedUnit_ 
- Trees: herarchies - nested treemaps = is a connected unweighted acyclic graph
- node - _similar terminology: nestedUnit_
- Unit: data item / record. Resource implementation
- File: Resource record

- port: _similar terminology = junction, synapse, group, insetionPoint, inlet/outlet, channel, junctionPoint, portal, relationship, relation_
- source/destination nodes - are nodes that make up the edges of a connection. _Or start/end nodes_
- path: a sequence of edges/connections that connect a sequence of nodes.
- connectionKey - _similar terminology: pathPointerKey_
- node inheritance - node that extends another node, in a way that any changes of the parent node is retained by the child node. _terminology: subnode, supernode, node extension/inheritance_ 
This is a better implementaiton for tree templates (extending an existing node tree without changing it) that used pathPointer or connectionPathSequence to reach the desired position for adding nodes inthe nested subtree/subnodes.
- override connection - node that extends/inherit from another node and overrides a specific connection of the supernode, if the supernode connectionKey is removed then the overriding connection of the subclass will be ignored.

â€¢ JS AST can be saved in a flat structure implemented in relationship graph, allowing reusability of nodes/units.

## Meta-API 
â€¢ Regarding Api of Api - Data about data is called metadata, and therefore api about an apit is metaApi. Used to create visual programming app, that reads the language api to choose AST options.

## Design Patterns
- Modular Application Architecture / Plugin-based architecture / plugin-based application / Plugin System Structure / Extending modules using a plugin architecture
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10763006/plugin-architecture-in-web-apps-examples-or-code-snippets
- A concept of prototype chain where constructors could be instantiated separately, creating a prototype chain with objects that are not strictly attached by a first contructor call. 
e.g. 
    ```
    let pluginContext = new PluginContext()
    let cacheContext = new CacheContext()
    // will create a chain with parameter objects involved.
    let controller = new Controller({ cacheContext, pluginContext })
    // will create a chain with parameter objects involved where one of them is dynamically changed, and the rest are shared accross "controler" instances.
    let controller = new Controller({ new CacheContext(), pluginContext })
    ```
    What the current behaviour of Javascript prototypal inheritance is that constructor creates a single object that delagates to constructor prototypes. What is missing is a way to allow delegation to upper dynamically created objects that relate to superconstructors (upper level classes) when needed. This allows to share context between specific instances and divide them into groups that do not affect each other and are soft linked (i.e. the shared context can be garbage collected like the instances that are part of it).

## Concept/Abstraction visual programming - programming using abstractions in a visual interface.
Naming proposal - just like `abstract syntax tree`, call it `abstract node graph`, `abstract visual programming`
