# Presentation: max 3 mins. 
- Short definition. 
- main purpose and usage examples. 
- principles of visual programming: spatial & temporal. 
- Vision: alternative to text programming utilities. 
- Steps to integrate into current deployment lifecycle / development workflow.
- technical implementation details and architecture.

# Points: 
- spatial & temporal representation, split program into procedures and sequece/control flow.
  - Visual representation: great for scatching spatial relationships. 
  - text is good for temporal/time relations.
- The programmer pictures the program, imaginning it as a graph, parts with connections. 
- During reading a program, the programmer jumps between blocks, not line by line as in text based programming. Creating a mental map of the code (maps imperfect by nature, as maps are a reduction of what they represent).
- Allows to view the program all at once.
- Procedural abstraction: making a shorthand for a piece of code. And naming of parts of code.
- Collapsable text blocks, abstracting currently unnecessary sections.

# Classification of Visual Programming Languages as a generalized purpose tool: 
- Block-based: e.g. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).
- Flow-based: represent state flows, data flows, logic flows.
  - Prograph (language designed in the 80s)
- all the rest etc ..
- Control flow of abstractions.

# Actual examples of specialized tools, not a generalized purpose languages:
  - Twillio studio
  - Unreal Engine 
  - Field of 3d and shaders design.
  - Field of music synthesis.
  - Field of IOT signal processing.
